<h2 id="orged8b7b8">The Current Governance Structure</h2>
<p>
SunPy's current governance was codified in 2014, it was written pre-numfocus and with the idea that SunPy might have to become it's own legal entity at somepoint in the future.
</p>

<p>
The governance of the project is split into two parts:
</p>

<ol>
<li><p>
The SunPy board
</p>

<blockquote >
<p>
The primary function of the advisory board is to elect an executive director, advise the executive, as well as review and vote on proposed SEPs.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
The Executive
</p>

<blockquote >
<p>
The role of the executive which is headed by the Executive Director, is to manage the day to day operations of the SunPy organization.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

</ol>

<h3 id="orgaa8ccab">Board Makeup</h3>
<p>
When the board was created in 2014 most of the members of the board where involved in day-to-day development.
</p>

<p>
Since then the make up of the board has been selected to bring a wider variety and background of experience to the project, particularly from groups in solar physics who are less represented in the developer community.
</p>

<section id="slide-org8e386b4" data-background="./images/background_1.jpg">
<h3 id="org8e386b4">Changes</h3>
<p>
The noteworthy changes to the governance documents for the project since they were written have been:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Added the recommendation that the Executive Director picks a deputy (2018).</li>
<li>Moved control of the financial matters from the board to the executive.</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="org4fb4b80">Objectives of Changing the Governance</h2>
<p>
This session is a forum for us to discuss (and hopefully decide on) what we want out of how the project is run, and the practical implementation of that.
</p>

<p>
Things I have thought of:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The project should be "run for the community <span class="underline">by</span> the community".</li>
<li>Developers should feel involved in governance, it should not be "someone else" running the project.</li>
<li>Simplicity: Minimise bureaucracy. The process of running the project shouldn't take more time than required.</li>

</ul>

<p>
Anything else?
</p>

<section id="slide-org6713b24" data-background="./images/background_1.jpg">
<h2 id="org6713b24">Proposed Structure</h2>
<p>
This is heavily inspired by Astropy's APE 0.
</p>

<ul>
<li>"Project Members" are trusted community members who manage the project for the community.</li>
<li>"The Executive" becomes an elected committee who have authority to make decisions and run the project.</li>
<li>"The Advisory Board" have no "hard" power, but run any elections and meet regularly with the committee to advise on how best to grow the project.</li>

</ul>

<section id="slide-org5bf8dd9" data-background="./images/background_1.jpg">
<h3 id="org5bf8dd9">An Aside on Complexity</h3>
<p>
In the process of thinking about this I have really struggled with the balance of complexity vs formality.
</p>

<p>
When writing governance documentation you want them to be resistant to malicious actors, and to no have many "grey areas".
</p>

<p>
This leads to formality and complexity, which I really want to avoid; we should consider this trade off in the discussions.
</p>

<section id="slide-orgb329c46" data-background="./images/background_1.jpg">
<h3 id="orgb329c46">"Project Members"</h3>
<p>
These people are the voting franchise for all SunPy elections, they have demonstrated significant participation in the community.
The project members can approve the addition of new project members.
</p>


<p>
<b>Decision</b>: We would need to decide both an initial criteria and an ongoing criteria.
</p>

<section id="slide-org673f2c8" data-background="./images/background_1.jpg">
<h4 id="org673f2c8">Astropy's criteria</h4>
<p>
Voting Members of the Astropy Project must demonstrate all of the following:
</p>

<ul>
<li>A good grasp of the philosophy of the Astropy Project</li>
<li>A solid track record of being constructive and helpful</li>
<li>Significant contributions to the Project's goals, in any form</li>
<li>A willingness to dedicate time to improving the Project</li>
<li>A willingness to recruit, train, and nominate new team members</li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="slide-org9f824d4" data-background="./images/background_1.jpg">
<h4 id="org9f824d4">Adding new project members</h4>
<p>
There should be a list of criteria for being an active voting member, against which candidates can be judged.
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>
Astropy have a formal vote open to all project members:
</p>

<blockquote >
<p>
To successfully
gain an appointment as a Voting Member, the nominee must receive at least four
positive votes, as long as that constitutes a majority of those voting.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li>yt had a similar system where someone could be proposed and as long as a number of people seconded the nomination the candidate was accepted, done via email.</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="org50d34b8">Removing project members</h4>
<p>
You always need a way to remove people in extreme situations :(
</p>

</section>
<section id="slide-org4cf771a" data-background="./images/background_1.jpg">
<h3 id="org4cf771a">The Executive (committee)</h3>
<p>
4 or 5 people who share the day-to-day responsibility for running the project.
</p>

<p>
Have a broad authority, but answerable to the project members (and the wider community).
</p>

<p>
Should seek consensus when making decisions.
</p>

</section>
<section id="slide-org39963db" data-background="./images/background_1.jpg">
<h4 id="org39963db">Electing the committee</h4>
<p>
<b>Decision:</b> Should we have elections if there are fewer candidates than seats?
</p>

</section>
<section id="slide-orgcce71cf" data-background="./images/background_1.jpg">
<h4 id="orgcce71cf">Removing the committee</h4>
<p>
There should be a mechanism where a recall election can be triggered.
</p>

</section>
<section id="slide-org1e211bd" data-background="./images/background_1.jpg">
<h3 id="org1e211bd">The Board</h3>
<p>
The board can remain practically largely unchanged, but with a different set of formal responsibilities.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Add the responsibility of managing elections?</li>
<li>Add the responsibility of being able to trigger a recall election (either at their discretion, or when petitioned by N project members)?</li>
<li>Serve as a Ombudsman for community to go to if there is a conflict with the executive committee.</li>
<li>Provide guidance as to the role of the Project in the context of the larger solar physics community</li>
<li>Ensuring consistent participation of the project in the community (e.g. tutorials at SPD, posters at AGU)</li>

</ul>

<p>
<b>Decision:</b> There should be a way of recalling the board? How?

<h2 id="org11956bd">Steps Forward</h2>
<p>
Taking into account all the notes from this session we need to draft a new version of SEP-0002.
</p>

<p>
Hack on this on Friday?
